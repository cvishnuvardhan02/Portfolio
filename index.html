                    <p class="description"> I’m a sportsman who loves staying active and competitive. Music is my escape, and dancing lets
                         me express myself in a whole new way. I’m also a gym freak, always pushing my limits and staying fit. On top of that,
                          I’m a coder, blending creativity and logic to build cool stuff.</p>
                    
                    <p class="description1">Person with a track record of achievements that make me proud, from winning local tournaments to
                         representing my team in competitive events. My dedication to sports has taught me discipline, teamwork, and resilience.  
                        On the tech side, I’ve actively participated in various tech events, from coding hackathons to innovative project showcases.
                         These experiences have helped me sharpen my technical skills, collaborate with brilliant minds, and stay updated on the

                        <b>University</b> <br>
                        I'm currently in my third year of B.Tech in CSE-AIML at Dayananda Sagar University, a place that's shaping me both academically and
                         personally. It's been an exciting journey exploring the endless possibilities of AI and machine learning while gearing up for a future in tech.

                        <b> Pre-University</b>
                        I completed my pre-university education at Narayana College, a place where I built a strong academic foundation 
                        under the State Board from 2020 to 2022. Those years were all about honing my skills and preparing for the next big steps in life.

                        I had the privilege of studying at The Oxford English School under the CISCE board from 2010 to 2020.
                         It was a decade of growth, learning, and unforgettable memories that shaped who I am today.

                <h4 class="ok">Cafe Bliss</h4>
                <p>"Cafe Bliss" is a website I developed to provide food enthusiasts with an online platform to explore and order a variety of dishes. It features an easy-to-navigate menu with detailed descriptions and prices, a user-friendly ordering system, secure payments, customer reviews, a rating system, and a blog with recipes and culinary tips. The design aims to create a welcoming, cozy café atmosphere.</p>

                <h4 class="ok">Climate Change</h4>
                <p>For the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024, I worked on a project simulating 50 years of CO2 emissions and global temperature rise to study climate change impacts. Using historical data and climate models, the simulation predicted future temperature trends under different emission scenarios, highlighting the urgency of climate change mitigation. It visualized how varying emission levels could affect global temperatures, contributing to extreme weather, rising sea levels, and biodiversity loss.</p>

            <div class="container3">
                <h4 class="ok">Banking Chatbot</h4>
                <p>The Banking Chatbot project, developed for my AI subject, provides an interactive interface for banking services. It helps customers with tasks like checking balances, transferring funds, making bill payments, and answering service-related queries. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning, the chatbot understands user queries and improves over time, offering a personalized experience. This project enhanced my understanding of AI applications in the banking sector.</p>

            <div class="container4">
                <h4 class="ok">Web app</h4>
                <p>I developed a web application for employee attendance tracking that uses geolocation to ensure attendance is recorded only within 500 meters of the company’s location, preventing fraudulent check-ins. The app features a user-friendly interface for logging in, viewing attendance records, and checking in/out. Built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, it securely stores data and improves attendance management efficiency while maintaining system integrity.</p>

                <h4 class="ok">OTN</h4>
                <p>The Organ Transplantation Network project is a DBMS designed to streamline organ donation and transplantation. It connects donors, recipients, and hospitals by storing detailed information on donors, recipients, transplant history, and hospital availability. The system matches compatible donors with recipients based on factors like blood type, medical condition, and location, while managing waiting lists, tracking organ status, and ensuring data privacy.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="container6">
                <h4 class="ok">ORC</h4>
                <p>The organized robotic car project involved designing a robot that autonomously navigates using sensors and controllers. It featured motors, sensors (e.g., ultrasonic for obstacle detection), and a microcontroller (like Arduino or Raspberry Pi) to process data and control movement. The goal was to enable the car to follow a path, avoid obstacles, and communicate with external systems for tasks like remote control or automated navigation, showcasing robotics and automation in real-world applications.</p>
